Diesel install on Windows with support for SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql

Introduction

I had a lot of troubles installing Diesel on Windows with support for all supported backends, SQLite, MySQL & Postgresql.
I have read many many web sites, blogs, forums, FAQs, projects issues, etc. to get this done and when I thought it was over I have finally made it.
I hope this helps.

OS version

My dev machine is a Windows 10 Pro with the 2020 May update.
